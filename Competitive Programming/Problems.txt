Problem 1: Given an array of N integers (It may contain both positive and negative integers) and a positive number K. We need to find the maximum sum that can be obtained from the array such that no more than K consecutive elements are picked.

Input: The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K. The second line contains N space-separated integers.

Output: For each test case, print a single line - the maximum sum possible.

Example Input: 1
               11 2
               5 9 6 -2 -6 6 7 9 8 5 -9

Example Output: 41

Explanation: 9 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 5 = 41

Problem 2: Given an array of N positive integers. Your task is to divide it into K segments so that minimum sum on the segment is maximum possible.

Input: The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K. The second line contains N space-separated positive integers.

Output: For each test case, print a single integer - the maximum possible minimum sum on the segment.

Example Input: 1
               10 4
               6 7 2 3 5 1 8 4 9 7

Example Output: 11

Explanation: The four groups are as follows: {6, 7}, {2, 3, 5, 1}, {8, 4}, {9, 7}. Minimum sum = 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11
